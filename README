This repository contains software to receive transmissions from a Davis
wireless Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS).  The CC1021-based transmitter in
the ISS can be received by the CC1110 in the IM-ME.

The pocketwx directory contains all the source code for this application.

You will need:
- a Davis ISS to listen to
- an IM-ME.  Right now the code is set for a unit that has a 27 MHz crystal
  but that will get fixed one of these days to work with 26 MHz units as
  well.
- a GoodFET (http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/)
- the sdcc compiler

Thanks to:
- Michael Ossman (http://greatscottgadgets.com/contact.html) for the IM-ME
  based spectrum analyzer on which this code is based
- Travis Goodspeed (http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.ca) for the GoodFET
- Joby Taffey (http://blog.hodgepig.org/) for PinkOS
- Dave (http://daveshacks.blogspot.ca/) for the original IM-ME reverse
  engineering effort.  Just amazing.
