This is the protocol used by the Davis Weather wiressless Integrated Sensor
Suite (ISS) to communicate its readings back to the console.

Packets are sent from the ISS every 2.5 seconds for an ISS set to a transmit ID of zero.  The rate gets slower as the transmit ID increases up to every 3 seconds (approximate: Davis Manual says "Wind Speed Update Interval: 2.5 to 3 seconds."  The data rate is 19.2 kbps and is transmitted from the ISS with least significant bit first.  More here:

The starting point for reverse engineering the protocol is the output from
the STRMON command when connected to the console with an LVTTL serial
connection.  This connection is discussed in detail in:

http://madscientistlabs.blogspot.ca/2011/01/davis-weatherlink-software-not-required.html

Let's use the following STRMON snippet as an example.

0 = 60
1 = 6
2 = d3
3 = ff
4 = c0
5 = 0
6 = 78
7 = 75

The eight bytes come from the ISS in this order.  However, each byte comes in from the ISS with least significant bit first.  The bit order has to be
flipped before we can work with it.  All values in the example above are in hex.  The ISS always transmits its data in Imperial units (fahrenheit, mph, inches Hg).  Conversion to other units is done in the console.

Byte 0: This is a header.  The upper nibble is the sensor the data is from.  The best guess right now is as follows, but these values are still to be confirmed.
  4 = probably UV
  5 = probably rainrate
  6 = probably solar
  9 = probably wind
  a = probably temperature
  c = probably humidity
  e = probably rain
  f = probably leaf

The lower nibble is the transmitter ID.
  0 = ISS
  1 = Anemometer transmitter
  4 = Temperature / humidity station
  5 = Envoy retransmitting ISS
  7 = Temperature / humidity station

Byte 1: Wind speed in mph.  Wind speed is updated every transmission.  Simple.

Byte 2: Wind direction from 1 to 360 degrees.  Wind direction is updated every transmission.  The wind reading is contained in a singly byte that limits the maximum value to 255.  It is converted to a range of 1 to 360 degrees by scaling the byte value by 360 / 255.  A wind speed reading of 0xd3 = 211 (decimal) * 360 / 255 = 297.  

Davis says that 0 indicates it can't get a reading, so you'd never see wind straight out of the North unless your wind vane is broken.

Bytes 3 - 5: Depend on the sensor being read at the time.  Need to work through these.

Byte 6: High byte of the 16 bit CRC (0x78 in our example above)
Byte 7: Low byte of the 16 bit CRC (0x75 in our example above)

The CRC is the same as that on the serial interface and is documented in the Davis "VantageSerialProtocolDocs_v230.pdf" document.  The first six bytes can be run through the calcuation and checked against the seventh and eight bytes.  Alternatively, all eight bytes can be run through the calculation and the result will be zero if the CRC is valid.  Pocketwx uses the CRC algorithm from http://www.menie.org/georges/embedded

To summarize:
- Byte 0 is a header.
- Byte 1 always represents wind speed
- Byte 2 always represents the wind direction
- Bytes 3-5 will carry other data according to the header in Byte 0
- Bytes 6 and 7 always represents the checksum with high byte first

From my notes to help work the rest of this out:

Signed values from the weather station console are two's complement, least significant byte first.  Note that pressure is measured by the console and not the ISS, so don't expect it to appear in the STRMON output.

Update rates below are from Davis' specs and manuals.  Data sizes and signing are as per the loop command and are what one might expect out of STRMON but not always.  I noted above that wind direction via STRMON is actually one byte unsigned.  There may be other exceptions.
- Outside temp: 10 seconds in 10th of a degree F, two bytes signed
- Winds speed: 2.5 seconds, one byte unsigned  (Byte 1 in STRMON, always)
- Wind direction: 2.5 seconds, two bytes unsigned from 1 to 360  (<-- one byte via STRMON, Byte 2 always)
- Outside humidity: 50 seconds in percent, one byte unsigned
- Rain: 10 seconds.  I believe this will be in counts of 0.01.
- Pressure: in Hg/1000, two bytes unsigned  (Rate????)
- Leaf Wetness: 40 seconds
- Soil Moisture: 40 seconds
- Solar radiation: 50 seconds
- UV: 50 seconds
- Soil Moisture: 62.5 seconds

I think all other outdoor related values are calculated in the console.

The only headers (ie Byte 0) I see from my wireless VP2 with no additional sensors connected are:

40 50 60 80 90 a0 e0

The rates they show up at are:
-40 shows either every 47.5 or 50 seconds
-50 shows every 10 seconds
-60 shows every 50 seconds
-80 shows every 10 seconds
-90 shows either 45, 47.5, or 50 seconds
-a0 shows alternately every 40 seconds and 10 seconds (interesting!)
-e0 shows every 10 seconds

These rates along with the rates given in the Davis manual should make correlating the data a lot easier.
