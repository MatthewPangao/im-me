Pocket Weather Station 

This is alternative firmware for the Girl Tech IM-Me
(http://www.girltech.com/electronics-imMe.aspx) that implements a receiver
for the Davis Instruments wireless Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS).  It is
compatible with both the ISS supplied with the Vantage Pro 2 and the
Vantage Vue.


WARNING!  You could destroy your device if you try to use this software.  You
certainly will not be able to get your device to work as originally intended
ever again.  There is no known way to recover the original firmware.


Installation:

For more complete instructions, see:

http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.com/2010/03/im-me-goodfet-wiring-tutorial.html

Abbreviated instructions follow:

1. Acquire or build a GoodFET (http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/).  There are
other ways to program the IM-Me, but you're on your own.  Trying to use
something like a Bus Pirate or an Arduino will only lead to frustration, as
the programming is sensitive to timing.

2. Wire your IM-Me to the GoodFET according to

3. Compile from source with sdcc and install with "make && make install".


Usage:

The software currently implements a debug display that shows the particulars
of the channel being monitored and the data being received.

Frequency selection:

The current channel frequency can be changed with the "A", "S", "D", and "F"
keys to step -1 MHz, -100 kHz, -10 kHz, and -1 kHz.  The "H", "J", "K", and
"L" keys step the same way in positive steps.

Sleep:

The power button will put the unit to sleep.

Thanks to Dave for an incredible job of reverse engineering the IM-Me and
sharing his code:

Thanks to Michael Ossmann for the very cool Pocket Spectrum Analyzer:

Thanks to Joby Taffey for PinkOS. Probably wouldn't have dared to plumb
the depths of packet handling without having his code as an example.

TODO:
- Implement frequency hopping
- Implement error handling
- Interpret and display the data
- Properly correct the offset frequency
- IFDEF the register settings for a 26 MHz IM-Me.  Mine is 27 MHz
- General code cleanup
